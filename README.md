Sure! Here's a sample README.md for your packagesart ROS2 workspace:

packagesart ROS2 Workspace
Welcome to the packagesart ROS2 workspace. This workspace consists of packages designed primarily for the racing bot built on the Raspberry Pi Mouse platform. Below you'll find details on each package and instructions to launch them.

Packages Overview
racing_bot_controller: Listens to /cmd_vel and publishes to /cmdmotor to drive the racing bot.
racing_bot_hat: Controls the Adafruit hat on the Raspberry Pi Mouse.
raspimouse: Contains the main fusion node for the racing bot.
raspimouse_description: Gazebo simulation for the Raspberry Pi Mouse racing bot.
realsense-ros: ROS2 package for the Realsense camera sensor.
rplidar_ros2: ROS2 package for the LIDAR sensor.


Special Note
For motors to function, ensure the pigpiod daemon is running. You can activate it by running:


$ sudo pigpiod
If this is not run, the motors will not operate.

Launching the Fusion Node
To launch the fusion node from the raspimouse package:

$ ros2 launch raspimouse combined_launch.py
Gazebo Simulation
To initiate the Gazebo simulation for the Raspberry Pi Mouse:

Copy code
$ ros2 launch raspimouse_description world2.launch.py
